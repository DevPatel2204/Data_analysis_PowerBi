# Store Analysis PowerBI Project

## Overview

This PowerBI project aims to analyze the performance of a retail store using data from two main files: `order.csv` and `Details.csv`. The analysis provides insights into various aspects of the store's operations, including sales trends, product performance, customer behavior, and more.

## Data Files

- **order.csv**: This file contains information about the orders placed at the store. It includes details such as order ID, customer ID, order date, total amount, etc.

- **Details.csv**: This file provides additional details about the products sold in the store. It includes attributes such as product ID, product name, category, price, etc.

## PowerBI Files

- **Store_Analysis.pbix**: This is the main PowerBI file that contains the data model, visualizations, and reports. It's where the analysis is performed and presented.

## Key Insights

1. **Sales Trends**: Explore the overall sales trends over time to identify peak periods, seasonal variations, and potential growth opportunities.

2. **Product Performance**: Analyze the performance of different products based on sales revenue, quantity sold, profit margins, etc. Identify best-selling products and underperforming items.

3. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or other relevant factors. Understand the characteristics of different customer groups and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

4. **Inventory Management**: Evaluate inventory turnover rates, stock levels, and product demand to optimize inventory management processes and minimize stockouts or overstocking.

5. **Sales Channels**: Analyze sales distribution across different channels (online, offline, etc.) and identify the most profitable channels for the store.
